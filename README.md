# Mikrus-PHP-website
A website designed for school usage, lightweight replacement for Dropbox/Facebook, my first real one in PHP

**Pros**:    
- you can locally host a server for your class and allow them to share articles and other files (in the future)
- teachers can access their class and moderate
- account activation system, so noone can access unless explicitly permitted
- it doesn't look too awful I guess
- I implemented security measures that prevent attacks such as SQL injection, XSS, etc

**Cons**:
- it's my first PHP website, so it's written with no regards to mantaining the code clean, as I had no clear plan what site should I do 
- written procedurally, rather than writing classes, little formatting as well
- HTML and PHP are mixed together in an ugly way, I should work on that
- functions.php has a.. tedious way of fetching arrays from db, as I couldn't get fetch_assoc to work (and I found it too late)
- still WIP
- it's written in PHP (I wanted to learn Django some time in the past, but oh well)
